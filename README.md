# The Web Development Bootcamp
I began [this Udemy course](https://www.udemy.com/the-web-developer-bootcamp/) to supplement an undergraduate Web Development course I took at Oregon State University. The various technologies and frameworks I learned are represented by each of the folders in this repository. 

While the course includes many smaller projects, the capstone was the YelpCamp application â€” a full-stack JavaScript application, with user authentication, made with Express and MongoDB. I deployed the application to Heroku [here](https://mysterious-eyrie-19058.herokuapp.com/).
